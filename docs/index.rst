Robotics & AI learning platform
=================================
Developed over several years of course instruction at Stanford University, our hands-on labs and curriculum offer comprehensive instruction in robotics and AI. Students learn foundational topics such as motor control and kinematics, as well as bleeding-edge subjects like visual reinforcement learning and LLM-powered autonomous agency.

Your robot friend
=================================
With the power of VLMs like ChatGPT, Pupper can listen and respond to you! Cameras, microphones, and proprioception enable Pupper to sense its environment. Speakers, a high resolution screen, expressive ears, and agile body enable Pupper to express its feelings through voice and motion.

Built with safety in mind
=================================
As a small and light-weight robot with several safety features, Pupper V3 is designed for use around people, including children. See details and advisories in the :ref:`safety` section.
