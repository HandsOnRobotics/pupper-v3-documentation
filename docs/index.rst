Pupper v3
#########################################

Pupper v3 is a cute companion robot designed to spark joy and teach robotics and AI. 

Everything is open source and you can build Pupper yourself for about $2000. Join our `Hands-On Robotics Discord community <https://discord.gg/qbmaU8NmP2>`_ to ask questions, share your progress, and get help from others! Pupper is made possible by the generous support of `Hands-On Robotics <https://www.handsonrobotics.org>`_.

Overview
=================================

Pupper can interact with users through voice and motion, and is designed to be safe around people, including children.

By training Pupper in simulation using reinforcement learning, we can teach it to walk over various obstacles in its way.

In just one hour, Pupper can experience 3 months of training by simulating many worlds at once.

Robotics & AI learning platform
=================================
Developed over several years of course instruction at Stanford University, our hands-on labs and curriculum offer comprehensive instruction in robotics and AI. Students learn foundational topics such as motor control and kinematics, as well as bleeding-edge subjects like visual reinforcement learning and LLM-powered autonomous agency.

Your robot friend
=================================
Pupper can listen and respond to you using VLMs. Cameras, microphones, and proprioception enable Pupper to sense its environment. Speakers, a high resolution screen, expressive ears, and agile body enable Pupper to express its feelings through voice and motion.

Built with safety in mind
=================================
As a small and light-weight robot with several safety features, Pupper V3 is designed for use around people, including children. See details and advisories in the :ref:`safety` section.

Get started building!
=================================

Pupper is open source and you can build it yourself! We have a detailed guide to help you through the process:
