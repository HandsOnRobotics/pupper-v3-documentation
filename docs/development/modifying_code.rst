Modifying Pupper code
===============================================

Steps
-------

#. SSH to Pupper with 

    ``ssh -L 8765:localhost:8765 pi@pupper.local``

#. Disable the stack from running on boot (one-time step)

    ``sudo systemctl disable robot``

#. Set correct permissions (one-time step)

    ``sudo chown -R pi /home/pi``

#. Modify code (see below)
#. Build code::

    cd ~/pupperv3-monorepo/ros2_ws
    ./build.sh

#. Launch stack

    ``ros2 launch neural_controller launch.py``


Code structure
----------------

The code is contained in the ``~/pupperv3-monorepo`` folder. 


The ROS code is contained within ``~/pupperv3-monorepo/ros2_ws/src``.

Examples
----------

Train a new RL policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Train a different policy using our colab `here <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Zo2p2u-VpFHtcHxb3qiSrB8qlHIezEiy?usp=sharing>`_.
#. Download the resulting .json policy file from the Weights and Biases run generated by the colab and put it in ``neural_controller/launch``
#. Update the ``model_path`` field inside the config file located at ``neural_controller/launch/config.yaml`` to point to the new policy file.

Add a new controller to control pupper movement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Make a new ROS2 package in ``~/pupperv3-monorepo/ros2_ws/src``.
#. Write a node that publishes /cmd_vel messages to the ``/cmd_vel`` topic.
#. Update the ``neural_controller/launch/launch.py`` file to include your new node and possibly disable the joystick twist publisher.
