Sourcing Parts
==================

Pupper is built from a variety of off-the-shelf, custom parts, and 3D printed components.
If you'd like to build Pupper from scratch, please refer to the bill of materials (BOM) linked below and purchase each part individually.
You can also buy a kit from:

* `Present Perfection <https://www.present-perfection.com/product-page/pupper-v3-full-kit>`_ run by our own fantastic kit builder Thinh Nguyen (Steve738 on Discord) who is based in San Jose, California, USA. He's built over 50 Pupper V3 kits for us so far.
* Unaffiliated robot supplier `AIFitLab <https://aifitlab.com/products/pupper-v3-stanford-open-source-robotics-dog?variant=43740448555144>`_ which is based in China.

PCBs
************************

Purchasing the two custom PCBs yourself (i.e. not in a kit) is a little tricky. The process is

#. Download the manufacturing files from the links in the BOM. 
#. Use JLCPCB's global sourcing service to order the BNO086 IMU, which is not available in JLCPCB's local parts inventory.
#. Once the IMU arrives in your global parts inventory, follow JLCPCB's PCBA ordering flow where you will upload the manufacturing files, configure settings, and order the two custom PCBs.
