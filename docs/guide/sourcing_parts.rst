Off-the-shelf parts
************************

These parts can be purchased from various vendors such as Amazon, Adafruit, McMaster-Carr, AIFitLab, etc.

Custom parts
************************

Pupper uses several custom parts:

* 3D printed parts
* Custom Raspberry Pi Hat (called the control board)
* Custom power distribution board

Purchasing the two custom PCBs is a little tricky. First, the manufacturing files must be downloaded from the links in the BOM. 
Then, use JLCPCB's global sourcing service to order the required BNO086 IMU. Once those arrive in your global parts inventory, 
follow JLCPCB's PCBA ordering flow where you will upload the manufacturing files, configure settings, and order the two custom PCBs. 

Buying a kit
------------------

To save you the pain of sourcing the parts yourself, we are working on a way for those interested to buy a kit from `Hands-On Robotics <https://handsonrobotics.org/>`_. Check back here in a few weeks for more information.
