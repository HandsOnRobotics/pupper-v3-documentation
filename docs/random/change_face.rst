Change Pupper's Face
=========================

You can change Pupper's face using the ``pcmanfm`` command to set the wallpaper.

.. code-block:: shell

    pcmanfm --set-wallpaper [IMAGE_PATH]

For example, to set the wallpaper to ``pupperface2.jpg``, you would run:

.. code-block:: shell

    pcmanfm --set-wallpaper pupperface2.jpg

There are a few face images already loaded onto the pi. You can find them in the following directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    /usr/share/rpd-wallpaper

They include the following:

- ``pupperface2.jpg``
- ``pupperface3.png`` (default)
- ``bmo9.jpg``

You can also add your own images to the ``/usr/share/rpd-wallpaper`` and use them as wallpapers.
